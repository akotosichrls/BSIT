//Simple Arithmetic in C
//Your birthday is approaching. You've been asked how much time is left until your special day (March 25th). Given that you've been asked on March 23rd,
//please write a C-program that performs arithmetic in order to produce the following output:

//Dear John, You still have to wait for X days (Y minutes or Z seconds) before your special day!

//Here, X is the remaining number of days (25-23), Y is the number of minutes (60 * 24 * X) and Z is the number of seconds (60 * Y).
//The sentence has to be exactly the one displayed above, replacing X, Y, and Z with the computed values. The format has to be followed precisely.

//Note: You cannot simply perform these calculations yourself and print the values - your program must calculate them and print them using the %d format specifier.



#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Dear John,\n");
    printf("You still have to wait for %d days (%d minutes and %d seconds) before your special day!\n",25-23,60*24*(25-23),60*(60*24*(25-23)));
    return 0;
}
