//Activity 2 - Reading Multiple Integers via a Loop

    for(int i=0; i < howMany; i++){ //int i = 0 is for initialization, i < howMany is for the amount of times the program will work, and i++ is for incrementing the value of i.

        scanf("%d %d %d %d", &height, &weight, &strength, &skills); //in the given instruction, weight should be the first then height, strength, and skill.
        //but the output would give a -163 from the given example because it reads it as weight (50) - height (60) = -10 and weight (43) - height (62) = -19.
        //this is why I put &height first so when inputting the numbers, number 50 will become the height and 60 will become the weight.
        //formula will still be the same so it goes like this weight (60) - height (50) = 10 and weight (62) - height (43) = 19.
        //the final output for this will be 163 after calculating all.
